            <p>Hey, my name is Matt. I used to be a to be an Accountant, most recently for a pharmaceutical company in RTP. Turns out accounting is REALLY boring. In comes the Coding BootCamp at UNC, where I decided to take a complete leap of faith and change my career path. Yikes, I know, but I'm really pumped for the opportunity that it can provide.</p>
            <p>As for my interests, I like basically all sports. My favorite would be basketball, which I still try to get to the gym and play at least once a week. I've been a Tar Heel fan from the womb. There is no better color than that shade of light blue. My ideal job would be an assistant coach to Roy Williams (I'm a realist, I'm not equiped to handle the head coaching duties...yet). But for now I'd be quite happy with a Web Development job.</p>
